Let's asume app name is 'bigdata'
1. find pid
sudo ps - ef | grep bigdata
2. find where application write logs
lsof -p <pid>
3. search for errors or exceptions in logs:
grep -i 'error\|exception' /var/log/bigdata.log
4. use strace command to see which system calls are made by application:
strace -f <pid>
