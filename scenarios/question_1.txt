I assume that all parts are running in the same server. We know which request is slow, https://example.com/test/index.php
- We should check how long it takes to the task to be processed in: Apache log, PHP log. Search for the request:
grep 'https://example.com/test/index.php' /var/log/httpd/access_log
- Check /etc/php.ini to find php log location amd searhc there as well: 
grep 'https://example.com/test/index.php' /var/log/test-php.log
- We can find which process consumes most CPU:
sudo top
- If CPU load is low, we can check IO load, search for processes which consume most resourses:
sudo iotop
- If no clues from there, check MySQL long runing queries. Login to MySQL DB console and execute:
show processlist;
If slow_query_log is enabled for MySQL you can check it as well.
